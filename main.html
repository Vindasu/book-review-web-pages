        <h4>
            To most of us, learning something "the hard way" implies wasted 
            time annd effort. Good teaching, we believe, should be creatively 
            tailored to the different learning styles of student sand should 
            use strategies that make learning easier. Make It Stick turns 
            fashionable ideas like these on their head. Drawing on recent 
            discoveries in cognitive psychology and other disciplines, the 
            authors offer concrete techniques for becoming more productive 
            learners.
